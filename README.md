# Statistics for Bioinformatics

This course, together with Structural Bioinformatics, makes up the second block of my MSc in Bioinformatics.

Each folder contains a readme file that represents the completed assignment, this file has been generated by the rmd file contained in the same folder. Each folder also contains the text of the assignment, the solutions provided by the professor and if needed, the data sets. 

Unfortunately the pace of the course was quite fast and the professor did not have the time to provide specific and complete feedback for each assignment. Therefore, there may be some errors in the readme of some folders. It is also worth to mention that I, and most of my collegues, did not have any previous knowledge of R and we started using it with this course.
