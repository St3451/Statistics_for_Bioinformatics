# Statistics for Bioinformatics

This course, together with Structural Bioinformatics, makes up the second block of my MSc in Bioinformatics.

Each folder contains a readme file that represents the completed assignment, this file has been generated by the rmd file (<code>assignment.rmd</code>) contained in the same folder. The same file is also present in pdf format (<code>assignment.pdf</code>) for a different visualization. Each folder also contains the text of the assignment (<code>text.pdf</code>), the solutions in pdf format provided by the professor (<code>solutions.pdf</code>) and if needed, the data sets. 

Assignments one to five were carry out in groups, the last assignment, the practice and the final exam were individual. Unfortunately the pace of the course was quite fast and the professor did not have the time to provide us specific and complete feedback for each group assignment. Therefore, there may be some errors in the readme of some folders (which I would like to fix in the future). It is also worth to mention that I, and most of my collegues, did not have any previous knowledge of R and learning it in this course was an exciting experience.
