# Statistics for Bioinformatics and eScience

[Statistics for Bioinformatics and eScience](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/nmak14029u), together with Structural Bioinformatics, makes up the second block of my MSc in Bioinformatics.

Assignments one to five were carry out in groups, the last assignment, the practice and the final exam were individual. Unfortunately the pace of the course was quite fast and the professor did not have the time to provide us specific and complete feedback for each group assignment. Therefore, there may be some errors in the readme of some folders (which I would like to fix in the future). It is also worth to mention that I, and most of my collegues, did not have any previous knowledge of R and starting to learn it with this course was an exciting experience :boom: :smile:.

## Repository structure

Each folder contains an rmd (i.e. <code>handin.rmd</code>) and a pdf file (i.e. <code>handin.pdf</code>) that represent the completed assignment. Each folder also contains a pdf file for the questions of the assignment (i.e. <code>questions.pdf</code>), the solutions provided by the professor (i.e. <code>solutions.pdf</code>) and if needed, the data sets.
